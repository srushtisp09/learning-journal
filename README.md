Its always about revising,I feel that makes you more confident  
DSA Learning Journal

Consistency beats intensity. One topic a day keeps the confusion away.
A personal, day-by-day journal to learn, revise, and showcase my understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms. This repo serves as my second brain for DSA — where raw confusion gets converted into clean notes over time.
Why This Exists

Because re-reading textbooks right before interviews doesn't work
Because writing things down forces you to actually understand them
Because having a public repo keeps you accountable
Because future-me will thank present-me for these notes

Each topic folder contains:

notes.md — concept explanation in my own words, dry runs, visuals (ascii), key takeaways
problems.md — problems solved, approach, code, and what I learned from each

How I Maintain This
WhatHowDaily goalAt least 1 concept or 1 problem per dayNote styleExplain it like I'm teaching someone elseDry runsDone manually on paper first, then written hereCodeWritten, tested, then pasted with explanationRevisionRevisit older topics every weekend
Note Format (per topic)
Each notes.md follows this structure:
## Topic Name

### What is it?
[ concept in simple words ]

### How does it work?
[ step by step explanation ]

### Dry Run
[ trace through an example manually ]

### Common Mistakes
[ things that tripped me up ]

### Key Takeaway
[ one liner to remember this forever ]

 What Makes This Different
This isn't just a collection of code snippets. Every note here represents a moment of understanding — dry runs, mistakes I made, analogies that clicked, and explanations written in plain english. If I can't explain it simply, I don't understand it yet.

 Goal
Complete a solid foundation of DSA within a consistent daily habit — not to rush, but to actually understand every topic well enough to explain it, trace it, and code it from scratch.
